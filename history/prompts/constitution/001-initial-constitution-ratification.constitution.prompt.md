## Prompt

Project Constitution: The Evolution of Todo
1. Development Principles
Architectural Integrity: Every feature must begin with a Specification and a Technical Plan.

SDD Strictness: No manual coding. All implementation must be generated by the AI agent based on approved tasks.

Language Standard: Python 3.12+ using PEP 8 style guidelines.

Modularity: Code must be organized into clear, testable functions or classes.

2. Technical Standards
Type Safety: All Python functions must include type hints.

Documentation: Every module must have a docstring explaining its purpose.

Data Integrity: In-memory storage must utilize standard Python data structures (lists/dictionaries) with proper validation.

3. UI/UX Standards
CLI Consistency: Console output must be clear, using consistent headers and success/error indicators.

2. The Specification (specs/phase1-console-app/spec.md)
The Specification defines what is being built. For Phase 1, the objective is a functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system.

## Response snapshot

Created v1.0.0 of "The Evolution of Todo Constitution" with 6 core principles:
- I. Architectural Integrity (spec-then-plan workflow)
- II. SDD Strictness (AI-generated implementation from approved tasks)
- III. Language Standard (Python 3.12+, PEP 8)
- IV. Modularity (testable functions/classes)
- V. Type Safety (mandatory type hints)
- VI. Documentation (mandatory docstrings)

Plus Technical Standards (data integrity with validation) and UI/UX Standards (CLI consistency). All templates verified compatible.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High - established foundational governance for Phase 1 development
- 🧪 Tests: N/A - governance document
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (.specify/memory/constitution.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.specify to create Phase 1 CRUD spec
- 🧠 Reflection: Clean initial ratification; user provided comprehensive principles

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A - manual governance review
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
