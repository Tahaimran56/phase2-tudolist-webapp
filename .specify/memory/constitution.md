# The Evolution of Todo Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Architectural Integrity

Every feature MUST begin with a Specification and a Technical Plan before any implementation work begins.

**Non-Negotiable Rules**:
- No code changes without an approved specification (`spec.md`)
- No implementation without a technical plan (`plan.md`)
- Design artifacts MUST be reviewed and approved before task generation

**Rationale**: Ensures deliberate design decisions and prevents ad-hoc development that leads to technical debt.

### II. SDD Strictness

All implementation MUST be generated by the AI agent based on approved tasks. No manual coding outside of the SDD workflow.

**Non-Negotiable Rules**:
- Tasks MUST be defined in `tasks.md` before implementation
- Implementation follows Red-Green-Refactor cycle when tests are specified
- Code changes MUST trace back to approved tasks

**Rationale**: Maintains traceability between requirements and implementation; ensures consistency and repeatability.

### III. Language Standard

All code MUST be written in Python 3.12+ following PEP 8 style guidelines.

**Non-Negotiable Rules**:
- Minimum Python version: 3.12
- PEP 8 compliance is mandatory
- Modern Python features (type hints, dataclasses, pattern matching) SHOULD be used where appropriate

**Rationale**: Ensures code consistency, readability, and access to modern language features.

### IV. Modularity

Code MUST be organized into clear, testable functions or classes.

**Non-Negotiable Rules**:
- Single Responsibility Principle: each function/class has one clear purpose
- Functions MUST be independently testable
- Avoid deep nesting; prefer composition over inheritance

**Rationale**: Enables unit testing, code reuse, and maintainability.

### V. Type Safety

All Python functions MUST include type hints.

**Non-Negotiable Rules**:
- All function parameters MUST have type annotations
- All function return types MUST be annotated
- Complex types SHOULD use `typing` module constructs (`Optional`, `Union`, `List`, etc.)

**Rationale**: Improves code clarity, enables static analysis, and catches errors early.

### VI. Documentation

Every module MUST have a docstring explaining its purpose.

**Non-Negotiable Rules**:
- Module-level docstrings are mandatory
- Public functions MUST have docstrings with parameter descriptions
- Classes MUST have docstrings explaining their responsibility

**Rationale**: Ensures code is self-documenting and maintainable by future developers (human or AI).

## Technical Standards

**Data Integrity**: In-memory storage MUST utilize standard Python data structures (lists, dictionaries) with proper validation.

**Non-Negotiable Rules**:
- Input validation MUST occur at system boundaries
- Data structures MUST be type-hinted
- CRUD operations MUST validate data before mutation

**Rationale**: Phase 1 focuses on in-memory storage; validation ensures data consistency without persistence complexity.

## UI/UX Standards

**CLI Consistency**: Console output MUST be clear, using consistent headers and success/error indicators.

**Non-Negotiable Rules**:
- Success messages MUST be clearly distinguishable from errors
- Output format MUST be consistent across all commands
- Error messages MUST be actionable and descriptive

**Rationale**: Users rely on CLI feedback for operation confirmation; consistency reduces cognitive load.

## Governance

**Constitution Supersedes All Practices**: This constitution is the authoritative source for development standards. Conflicts with other documents MUST be resolved in favor of the constitution.

**Amendment Procedure**:
1. Proposed changes MUST be documented with rationale
2. Changes MUST be reviewed for impact on existing artifacts
3. Version number MUST be incremented per semantic versioning:
   - MAJOR: Backward-incompatible principle changes or removals
   - MINOR: New principles or material expansions
   - PATCH: Clarifications and non-semantic refinements

**Compliance Review**:
- All PRs/reviews MUST verify constitution compliance
- Violations MUST be documented and justified if unavoidable
- Use `CLAUDE.md` for runtime development guidance

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-12-21 | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-21
